# Retrieve AMI IDs by Name Pattern

This PowerShell script retrieves Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs based on a name pattern using the AWS CLI. It helps you find and log AMIs that match a specific naming convention, such as backups or versioned images.

- Accepts a wildcard name pattern for AMIs (e.g., `your_ami_name*`)
- Queries AWS for AMIs that match the pattern
- Appends each AMI ID to `ami-id-list.txt`, with one ID per line
